# README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version

* System dependencies

* Configuration

* Database creation

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

## Deployment instructions

These deploy instructions are geared specifically for Digital Ocean deployments.
Since the app requires persistent storage and the ability to run some system
calls to git, services like Heroku, Dokku, and highly managed VPS systems without
root capability won't meet the needs of the app.

I chose Digital Ocean because of name recognition, but any VPS with root access
and persistent storage should work for deployment.

Digital Ocean spins up Ubuntu 18.04 on their Droplets, and this app was developed
on Ubuntu 18.04, so if you can get a machine running that, you'll likely run into
the fewest stumbling blocks.
